My additional feature is the inclusion of 2 special abilities. Both are available to the player at
any time (as long as they're in the "game" state). Both come with advantages and drawbacks.

The first ability doubles the player's movement speed (pressing space). However, this comes at the cost
of points every frame that its used, so if a player relies on this too much, it'll be harder for them
to get a higher score than someone who uses it less. However, as more collectables are added, using this
becomes more of a necessity to stay alive, so it becomes a game of balancing benefit vs cost.

The second ability slowly drags all the collectables on the screen towards them. Instead of costing points,
this ability costs time instead. As long as the left shift key is held, all the objects will drift
towards the player, but the timer will go down at 1.25x speed. This is yet another risk/reward ability
that requires skill to use properly. When used right, it sets up for quick sweeps of several gems at once.
When used poorly, it can and will just end your run right there.
